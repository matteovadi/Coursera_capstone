    "This notebook is an introduction to the capstone project and it will main deal with it. The capstone refers to Location data, which concerns the description of places and venues, such as their geographical location, their category, working hours, full address, and so on, such that for a given location given in the form of its geographical coordinates (or latitude and longitude values) one is able to determine what types of venues exist within a defined radius from that location. Let's get started with some basics lines of code for importing NumPy and Pandas libraries in Python."
